% Exercise: 
% %%%%%%%%
% Randomly sample 500 patches from texture 'img/cottonBlue.png' and
% 'img/fabric.png' respectively. Represent each patch using Weyl
% Coefficients invariant to the group of transformations G defined in Lab 3. 
% Visualized patch Weyl and intensity (raw pixel value) representations of both 
% textures with the dimension reduced to 3 using PCA. 
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Note: We suggest to randomly sampled 16x16 patches from each texture. 
% Each patch is broken down into smaller 4 by 4 sub-patches, their Weyl transforms 
% calculated, and their absolute values summed accordingly over all sub-patches
